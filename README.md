# 🎗 Breast Cancer Detection Using IR Images (CNN & SVM)

## 📌 Overview
Early detection of breast cancer significantly improves treatment success rates. This **Machine Learning-based system** uses **Infrared (IR) Images** to classify breast cancer as **benign or malignant**, leveraging **CNN** and **SVM** for high accuracy.

---
## 🎯 Problem Statement
> Traditional breast cancer detection methods (e.g., mammography) can be costly and inaccessible. This project aims to develop an affordable, non-invasive, and AI-powered approach for breast cancer detection using IR thermal imaging.
